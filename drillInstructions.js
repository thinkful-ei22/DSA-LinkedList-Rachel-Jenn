Doubly linked list
Implement a doubly linked list. The primary functions of the doubly linked list would be insert (First, Last, Before, After, and insertAt), remove, and find. Write a function mainDLL. Within the function create a doubly linked list called DLL and add the following items in your doubly linked list. Aquaria, Caprica, Gemenon, Picon, Sagittaron

Add Tauron to the list
Remove Picon from the list
Reverse a DLL
Given the doubly linked list above, write a program that reverses the doubly linked list. How is this implementation different than reversing the singly linked list?
